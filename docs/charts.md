# Chart Types and Data Presentation

While the package used ([c3](http://c3js.org/), [d3](https://d3js.org)) are capable of higly sophisticated graphic displays,
Storyrevealer aims at, and purposely limits itself to, very simple, clear, straightforward, bold, graphs.

Most graphs are animated but not interfactive.

Please refer to [c3 documentation](http://c3js.org/examples.html) for detailed information on data format.
