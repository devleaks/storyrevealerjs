# Storyrevealer.js

Simple, json-fed story teller engine based on [Reveal.js](http://revealjs.com).

Inspired by the elegance and simplicity of [deltatre' SportTeller](http://www.deltatre.com/online-solutions/sportteller/)
(with examples
[here](http://www.europeantour.com/sportteller/us-open-day-4-in-numbers.html),

and

), I deciced to make a simpler, free, alternative.

Storyrevealer creates a single web page, called a newspaper, which contains stories.
A story is a list of pages.

A page is a background image, animation, or video, with content laid over it.
Content is a collection of information displayed as text, table, or graphics.

Storyrevealer uses Reveal.js plugins, like the Anything plugin, to display and animate your content.
(Anything plugin is so generic that you can really stick anything in a slide' section)

Storyrevealer just started, so expect documentation, tests, and complex examples in the following weeks.
